# TFS Solution History

`View Complete Solution History by a single click`

TFS lacks the functionality to view the history of a solution projects altogether.

The exisiting `View History` context menu in Visual Studio will only show those changeset that caused a change to the .sln file like adding or removing a project.

TFSSolutionHistory will get all the projects history and combine them altogether.

## Features
* User filter

## Alternatives

The closest existing solution to the problem is via `Find Changeset` and then filtering the `User` with your own name. Although this will only show your own changes.
